1) Summary Paragraph: complete one per week
A summary is a “just the facts” type of free-write. What was the reading about?
 Explain what happened in the reading you did for that session, day, or week—focus on key events and details.
 Introduce us to new characters, and update us with what is new with major characters we have met before.
 Perhaps end with a prediction about what you think will happen next in the story—be sure to base that prediction on textual
evidence from your summary (in other words, the foreshadowing).
2) Reading Strategy Free-write: complete four different choices below per week
Questions (Comprehension)
What are the big ideas the author seems to be asking about. Use the subjects on the back of this sheet to build two or three
big idea questions (level 3), and explore BOTH the answers the author seems to suggest through the story AS WELL AS
your own ideas.
Predictions (Comprehension)
Make a prediction about what is going to happen next; these could be plot events or conflict developments. Use textual
evidence to support why you think your prediction is likely to develop, and explain in depth what is giving you this idea.
Passages (Literature Study)
Select a specific passage from your reading that you have determined to be especially important to your reading for the day.
Explain what make the passage stand out by analyzing how it move the plot forward through rising action, develops a
character, and /or addresses one of the big ideas in the story.
Characters (Literature Study)
Explain how the reading for the day develops a major character. Discuss new developments for the character, personal
growth they experience, and internal and external conflicts in progress. Make predictions about how these conflicts will
play out as you read on.
Connections (Literature Study)
Synthesize, (in other words, connect), what you have been reading about with other books you have read, movies you’ve
seen, current events, and your own life experience. Explain specifically what reminds you of what, why, how, and what big
ideas and emerging messages are suggested by the connection.
Word Study (Word Study)
Identify 1-3 words that seem to be extra significant to the development of characters, ideas, and themes in the reading for the
day. For each word, discuss its meaning in the context in which it is found in the text, and explain why the word seems to
be central to the writer’s character/big idea/theme development.
Reflective Free-write (Reading Comprehension, Literature Study, or Word Study)
This is an open-ended free-write that explores what you are thinking about what you are reading. You might speculate
on big ideas and the big idea questions the author is exploring. You might consider what you enjoy about this book, and/or
what makes it challenging to read. You can go any direction, but remember to keep it focused on specific characters, events,
and details from the text.
