# Reo5:Watchmen

## Summary

In Chapter 11, Rorschach and Dan arrive at Adrian's HQ. Adrian is prepared for their arrival, and once they get there, he explains to them his plans to save the world. He has set into motion a series of nuclear events to destroy the world. Adrian confesses that he did murder Blake because Blake became aware of his plans. To keep suspicion away from himself, Adrian devised attacks to make it appear that some enemy was out to murder the former Watchmen. Rorschach and Nite Owl are not powerful or smart enough to stop Ozymandias, and the nuclear destruction starts. The final chapter of Watchmen opens with scenes of murdered citizens in New York City. Adrian has made it appear that an alien is responsible for the attacks. Jon transports himself and Laurie to Adrian’s hideout and the two confront Adrian. Adrian tricks Jon into one of his machines, and he uses energy to dismantle Jon. However, Jon is able to restructure himself as he did in the past.  Meanwhile, the news reports on the television claim that cities around the globe are uniting in the face of destruction to save themselves from alien attack. Adrian is happy that he has been able to get people to unite, and Jon agrees that this is important. The others want to turn Adrian in to the authorities; however, Jon says that the key to keeping peace is remaining silent. Rorschach didnt agree, so Jon kills him and leaves, a reporter takes Rorschach’s journal and runs a peice on it.

## Characters

Rorschach is probably the most complex characters in the novel. (makes sense he is the stories POV character for the most part.) He is deemed a sociopath by many(And also would be officaly classified as one.), and indeed his past was riddled with abuse and violence that altered his character. Kovacs's mother was a prostitute, and when he was younger, he became the victim of taunting by neighborhood boys on account of his mother’s reputation. Furthermore, his mother often physically abused him and regarded him as a burden. Rorschach took up crime fighting to rid the world of such evil influences. He claims that he ceased to be Walter Kovacs during a mission to find a kidnapped girl: he found that her kidnapper had killed her and fed her to his dogs to cover up his crime. Rorschach killed him on the spot, and with that murder lost any trace of innocence that he may have had left.


The Comedian is a cynical character who believes that human nature is ultimately savage. He does not believe that the world can be saved, yet he continues to play a role in crime busting, claiming that he will have the last joke on humanity when it destroys itself in spite of significant intervention. He also sees them as fundamentaly evil, Rorschach says that everyone else hides from the evils of humanity and yet the comedian accepts this. He admires him for that.



Utilitarianism: Utilitarianism is the belief that an action is right if it results in happiness for everyone affected, not just the person who instigated it. Adrian Veidt subscribes to this theory. Even though he knew his plan for world peace would result in the deaths of millions of people, he also knew millions and millions more around the world would benefit from it.
Egoism: Egoism is the belief that people should pursue actions that are in their own self-interest. They do not care about the fate of anyone else affected by the action. This theory applies to the Comedian. He couldn't wait to leave Vietnam when the war was over even though his Vietnamese girlfriend was pregnant with his child. She pleads with him to stay, saying she can't forget the child that grows inside of her. He tells her, "Well, that's unfortunate, because that's just what I'm gonna do." She attacks him with a broken beer bottle, so he shoots her. Her death (and that of her unborn child) was in only his best interest, not hers. Until he figured out the magnitude of Adrian's plan, he cared only for himself.
Deontological ethics: Utilitarianism and egoism fall under the category of teleological ethics, which state that the "rightness" of an action is determined by result of that action. If the result of the action is good, then the act is morally good. The opposite of that is deontological ethics, which separates the morality of the action from its outcome. A moral action can still have a negative outcome. That's how Rorschach operates. He feels morally obligated to tell the world about Adrian's plan. That would undoubtedly disrupt world peace, but it's still the right thing to do. His version of morality is very black and white, and he has no patience in the gray areas in which Adrian dabbles.
