>Evil must be punished. Even in the face of Armageddon I shall not compromise.
Rorschach, Chapter 1

Rorschach's strict moral code pushes him to investigate the Comedian's murder even when it seems like the world is on the brink of nuclear destruction. He realizes one death may not matter a lot in the grand scheme of things, but he cannot let a wrong go unpunished.


## Word Study
Manhattan Project

 : The Manhattan Project was a research and development undertaking during World War II that produced the first nuclear weapons. It was led by the United States with the support of the United Kingdom and Canada. From 1942 to 1946, the project was under the direction of Major General Leslie Groves of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Nuclear physicist Robert Oppenheimer was the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory that designed the actual bombs. The Army component of the project was designated the Manhattan District; Manhattan gradually superseded the official codename, Development of Substitute Materials, for the entire project. Along the way, the project absorbed its earlier British counterpart, Tube Alloys. The Manhattan Project began modestly in 1939, but grew to employ more than 130,000 people and cost nearly US$2 billion (about $22 billion in 2016 dollars). Over 90% of the cost was for building factories and to produce fissile material, with less than 10% for development and production of the weapons. Research and production took place at more than 30 sites across the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada.


The name Dr. Manhattan is a clear and unsubtle reference to the manhattan project, I personaly think that this is intresting because it shows that he is a unparralelled power. And doesnt realy care about humanity at large. Ultimate power fundamentaly alienates from society at large, it is meant to suggest that humans are not suposed to wield powers as large as atomic weapons.


Rorschach

 : The Rorschach test is a psychological test in which subjects' perceptions of inkblots are recorded and then analyzed using psychological interpretation, complex algorithms, or both. Some psychologists use this test to examine a person's personality characteristics and emotional functioning. It has been employed to detect underlying thought disorder, especially in cases where patients are reluctant to describe their thinking processes openly.[4] The test is named after its creator, Swiss psychologist Hermann Rorschach. In the 1960s, the Rorschach was the most widely used projective test.[5]


Rorschach is named the way he is to demonstrate that his psychological issues come from childhood. The Rorschach test itself is a byproduct of freudian psycology. And you can see a lot of that mirrored in Rorschach himself. His trauma is largely due to him being mistreated and bullied as a child, a classical freudian diagnosis.



## Characters
Rorschach

Rorschach is most comfortable in his crime-fighting outfit: trench coat, gloves, porkpie hat, and black-and-white full-face mask. He continues practicing vigilantism even after the Keene Act prohibits it. Disgusted by sex and greed and suspicious of women, Rorschach holds to a right-wing moral code that prevents him from compromising where the truth is concerned. This in particular is very intresting. As he is the protagonist, but I feel like the entire book is convinced that Rorschach is right. No one in the book so far has been forgiven for there crimes, as a general rule the book is convinced that everyone is evil and violoent.



Dr. Manhattan

Big, blue, and incredibly naked, Dr. Manhattan is the not-so-secret weapon in the United States' ongoing nuclear tensions with Russia. He is also utterly omnicent, he has the ability to manipulate anything, he can also see his own past and future. He put himself back together atom by atom and developed the ability to engage with objects at the atomic level. He is also of the opinion that the universe is fundamentaly deterministic. And that time is fundamentaly unmovable. It draws heavily on the scientific theory of SR. As it confirms that time on the whole is an immovable 4D crystal.
