Rorschach

 : The Rorschach test is a psychological test in which subjects' perceptions of inkblots are recorded and then analyzed using psychological interpretation, complex algorithms, or both. Some psychologists use this test to examine a person's personality characteristics and emotional functioning. It has been employed to detect underlying thought disorder, especially in cases where patients are reluctant to describe their thinking processes openly.[4] The test is named after its creator, Swiss psychologist Hermann Rorschach. In the 1960s, the Rorschach was the most widely used projective test.[5]


Rorschach is named the way he is to demonstrate that his psychological issues come from childhood. The Rorschach test itself is a byproduct of freudian psycology. And you can see a lot of that mirrored in Rorschach himself. His trauma is largely due to him being mistreated and bullied as a child, a classical freudian diagnosis.



## Characters
Rorschach

Rorschach is most comfortable in his crime-fighting outfit: trench coat, gloves, porkpie hat, and black-and-white full-face mask. He continues practicing vigilantism even after the Keene Act prohibits it. Disgusted by sex and greed and suspicious of women, Rorschach holds to a right-wing moral code that prevents him from compromising where the truth is concerned. This in particular is very intresting. As he is the protagonist, but I feel like the entire book is convinced that Rorschach is right. No one in the book so far has been forgiven for there crimes, as a general rule the book is convinced that everyone is evil and violoent.



Dr. Manhattan

Big, blue, and incredibly naked, Dr. Manhattan is the not-so-secret weapon in the United States' ongoing nuclear tensions with Russia. He is also utterly omnicent, he has the ability to manipulate anything, he can also see his own past and future. He put himself back together atom by atom and developed the ability to engage with objects at the atomic level. He is also of the opinion that the universe is fundamentaly deterministic. And that time is fundamentaly unmovable. It draws heavily on the scientific theory of SR. As it confirms that time on the whole is an immovable 4D crystal.

> You know how every damn thing in this world fits together except people!
Janey (Manhattans first GF), Chapter 3

Janey says this to Dr. Manhattan shortly after the assassination of John F. Kennedy. She's trying to tell him he lost his humanity when he became a superhuman. His inability to understand the more illogical aspects of human nature prevent him from being a true superhero. This is also a continuation of his perception of time as an immovable and deterministic.
