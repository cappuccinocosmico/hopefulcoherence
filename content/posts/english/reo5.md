Laurie Juspeczyk is in California visiting her mother, Sally Jupiter, the original Silk Spectre, who lives in an assisted-living community. Laurie tries to hide the fact that Dr. Manhattan is at the Comedian's funeral, but Sally knows all about it from reading the newspaper. Laurie can't understand why her mother doesn't hate the Comedian for trying to rape her years earlier; Sally says, "[Y]ou're young. You don't know. Things change." She shows Laurie old "Tijuana Bibles," or pornographic comics from the 1930s and 1940s, of which she is the subject. Laurie is disgusted, but Sally finds them flattering.

The panels about Sally and Laurie are interspersed with scenes from the Comedian's funeral in New York. Dr. Manhattan, Dan Dreiberg, Adrian Veidt, and a retired villain named Moloch all attend. Their thoughts are shown as flashbacks, presented in chronological order.

1940s: The Comedian makes unwanted sexual advances toward Sally. She fights him, but she's not strong enough to ward off his punches and kicks. Hooded Justice walks in and beats up the Comedian, who makes a snide comment about Hooded Justice's sexual proclivities.
Circa 1966: Ozymandias (Adrian Veidt) is at the first meeting of the Crimebusters, which includes Dr. Manhattan, Silk Spectre II (Laurie), Captain Metropolis, Rorschach, and the Comedian. Captain Metropolis is eager to create an organized group of masked crime fighters, the first since the Minutemen disbanded in 1949. The Comedian doesn't see the point because "inside 30 years the nukes are gonna be flyin' like maybugs." The meeting unravels.
Early 1970s: The United States has won the Vietnam War. In a Vietnamese bar, Dr. Manhattan looks on as a visibly pregnant Vietnamese woman tells the Comedian he can't just walk away from his unborn child. She smashes a bottle in his face, and he shoots her. Dr. Manhattan reprimands the Comedian, who points out that Dr. Manhattan didn't do anything to stop him. "You don't really give a damn about human beings," he tells the perplexed blue superhuman.
1976: Nite Owl (Dan Dreiberg) and the Comedian are holding off a horde of New Yorkers who appear to be rioting against the superheroes themselves. The Comedian tells Nite Owl he's heard rumors about a new law on the horizon, but until then they are "society's only protection." Nite Owl asks who, exactly, they're protecting the citizens from. "From themselves," the Comedian says.
1985: A week before his death, the Comedian breaks into the apartment of Moloch, his former nemesis. Drunk and crying, he rants about a "joke" gone too far. The Comedian goes on and on about how the bad things he's done are nothing like what's coming. He mentions a mysterious island and artists and scientists, but Moloch has no idea what he's talking about.
After scaring Moloch into sharing the final flashback, Rorschach goes to the Comedian's gravestone. He ruminates on the violent ends that come to those who practice violence. The chapter ends with a lyric from Elvis Costello's song "The Comedians."


Chapter 2's flashbacks show the lack of camaraderie between the masked vigilantes of the 1930s, '40s, and '60s. They work as individuals or pairs rather than as a cohesive unit. This is particularly true for the Comedian, one of two vigilantes who were members of the Minutemen and the would-be Crimebusters. In this chapter, the only time the reader sees him attempt to connect with another vigilante is when he tries to rape Sally. He wants her body, not her companionship or professional partnership. He refuses to join the Crimebusters not only because he thinks nuclear war is imminent but because he doesn't think his fellow crime fighters are capable of handling America's problems. The Comedian doesn't trust any of the other vigilantes, even Dr. Manhattan, whom he suspects is losing touch with humanity and becoming a "flake." So, when he comes across terrifying information about the future of the United States, he doesn't turn to the "good guys"—he goes straight to his former enemy, Moloch, who is so ill he can't do anything.

What the Comedian has always predicted—the end of the world—appears finally to be coming to fruition. Although he's terrified of the future, he doesn't do anything to stop it. This, coupled with his insistence there's no use fighting small-time crooks and thugs when nuclear war could happen any day, is evidence of his fatalistic outlook on life. Fatalism is the philosophical idea that some things, like social inequality and war, are preordained and therefore unchangeable by humans. The Comedian sees no point in working together to quell societal disruptions since nuclear war is going to end the world anyway. Likewise, he has little use for meaningful personal connections with those engaged in the same line of work. He feels the greatest connection to the man he spent so much of his career chasing; he identifies more with criminals than with heroes.

This brings up questions readers might ask throughout Watchmen: What makes a hero? Who decides who is good and who is bad? The Comedian is characterized as one of the "good guys" because he fights "bad guys" for the U.S. government. That doesn't necessarily make him a good person. He revels in riots and takes great pleasure in killing people in Vietnam. He even kills his girlfriend and their unborn baby without a second thought. Though he is technically a hero, he's also depicted as morally corrupt. The Comedian helps further the novel's theme of flawed heroes, a response to the moral superiority and unattainable perfection of comic book heroes before the mid-1980s.

One of Watchmen's most important graphic elements is the yellow smiley face, which the Comedian pins to the left shoulder of his costume. It first appears in the flashbacks about Vietnam, and it eventually comes to represent the Comedian's belief that world politics are just one big unpleasant joke. The little yellow smiley face was created in 1963 by graphic designer Harvey Ross Ball, who made it for the State Mutual Life Assurance Company, which used it in morale-boosting ads targeted toward its employees. The icon didn't become widely recognized until 1971, when the owners of a Philadelphia Hallmark store added the words Have a Happy Day to the image. More than 50 million buttons were sold that year. Even American soldiers on the ground in Vietnam wore the pins, albeit with irony. The Comedian adopts the symbol as a pointed jab against a society that championed optimism during some of the darkest times in global history.

Who are we protecting them from?
Dan Dreiberg, Chapter 2

Dan asks this question as he and the Comedian hold rioting New Yorkers at bay in 1975. The crowd is rioting against the vigilantes, and Dan is beginning to question the usefulness of the vigilantes' profession. The Comedian responds that they're protecting civilians from "themselves," but Dan doesn't seem so sure.

Yes, we were crazy, we were kinky, we were Nazis.
Hollis Mason, Under the Hood (Chapters 3 and 4)

Alan Moore's masked vigilantes are nothing like the superheroes of old. All flawed in some way, they seem more human than the traditional superhero of the 1960s and '70s. Some of these flaws—Rorschach's terrible childhood, for example—make the characters more sympathetic, while others—like Hooded Justice's admiration for Hitler—make them harder to like.

4.

You know how every damn thing in this world fits together except people!
Janey Slater, Chapter 3

Janey says this to Dr. Manhattan shortly after the assassination of John F. Kennedy. She's trying to tell him he lost his humanity when he became a superhuman. His inability to understand the more illogical aspects of human nature prevent him from being a true superhero.

Identity

As masked crime fighters, all of Watchmen's main characters have dual identities. In some cases the alter egos are the personalities each vigilante wishes they had in "real" life. Dan Dreiberg, for example, feels more confident and powerful when he's dressed as Nite Owl. When he snaps on his utility belt, he no longer worries about nuclear war or unrequited love. Rorschach, whose vigilante work often ends in violence, is better equipped to acknowledge and address the evils of society when he disappears behind his mask. As Walter Kovacs, he couldn't deal with the way he brutally murdered Gerald Grice's German Shepherd, but as Rorschach the gore doesn't bother him at all. It's a necessary means to an end.

Rorschach eventually comes to find himself identifying more with his vigilante persona than his everyday self, which is why the persona of Rorschach supersedes that of Walter Kovacs to become his primary identity. The same thing happens with Adrian Veidt. For Rorschach, leaving behind Walter Kovacs is symbolic of his decision to move past the difficulties of childhood. For Adrian, embodying the role of Ozymandias outside of work represents his belief that he is an all-powerful ruler on par with Alexander the Great and Ramses II. Both men view their "regular" personas as disguises of their true selves. These disguises of normalcy are imperative for gathering intel and, in Adrian's case, building fortunes and good will, but each man prefers to wear the personalities of their crime-fighting alter egos.

Some of the characters in Watchmen also lose their identities. Sally Jupiter, nee Juspeczyk, does it on purpose. She changes her last name to "Jupiter" to erase the Polish part of her heritage at a time when Poles were looked down upon in the United States. Dr. Manhattan slowly and inadvertently loses his human identity after his transformation from blond scientist to blue superhuman. He is more in tune with atomic structure than human emotion, and as the years pass, he becomes less and less able to empathize with individuals and humanity as a whole. By 1985 he sees himself as separate from the people he's there to protect. Only Laurie Juspeczyk treats him as if he were mortal. She refers to him by his original name, Jon, and continually implores him to think about the emotional impact of his actions. Their breakup cuts the last string tethering him to humanity, and he departs Earth for a world devoid of human emotion and convoluted logic.

Ethics and Morality

Each of the masked vigilantes in Watchmen has a different set of morals and ethics. Ethics are the moral principles that influence a person's behavior, while morality determines whether an action is right or wrong. As there is no universal guideline for morals and ethics, it is up to each person to decide what is best for them. In Watchmen that means several different viewpoints about what makes an action acceptable or not. These differences are best described by three different ethical philosophies.

    Utilitarianism: Utilitarianism is the belief that an action is right if it results in happiness for everyone affected, not just the person who instigated it. Adrian Veidt subscribes to this theory. Even though he knew his plan for world peace would result in the deaths of millions of people, he also knew millions and millions more around the world would benefit from it.
    Egoism: Egoism is the belief that people should pursue actions that are in their own self-interest. They do not care about the fate of anyone else affected by the action. This theory applies to the Comedian. He couldn't wait to leave Vietnam when the war was over even though his Vietnamese girlfriend was pregnant with his child. She pleads with him to stay, saying she can't forget the child that grows inside of her. He tells her, "Well, that's unfortunate, because that's just what I'm gonna do." She attacks him with a broken beer bottle, so he shoots her. Her death (and that of her unborn child) was in only his best interest, not hers. Until he figured out the magnitude of Adrian's plan, he cared only for himself.
    Deontological ethics: Utilitarianism and egoism fall under the category of teleological ethics, which state that the "rightness" of an action is determined by result of that action. If the result of the action is good, then the act is morally good. The opposite of that is deontological ethics, which separates the morality of the action from its outcome. A moral action can still have a negative outcome. That's how Rorschach operates. He feels morally obligated to tell the world about Adrian's plan. That would undoubtedly disrupt world peace, but it's still the right thing to do. His version of morality is very black and white, and he has no patience in the gray areas in which Adrian dabbles.

Morals also affect the lives of some of the minor characters in Watchmen. Those who congregate at the newsstand (Dr. Malcolm Long and his wife, Gloria; Joey and Aline; Bernard and Bernie) can be divided into two groups: those who feel a moral obligation to help others and make things right and those who believe everyone must fend for themselves. Aline tries to help Joey by giving her a self-help book, and when they fight, Dr. Long goes against his wife's wishes and tries to break it up. It turns out, however, that it is the Comedian who is right: it doesn't matter if people try to help each other or not. We are all going to die in the end.

Fate

The idea of fate plays a large role in the actions of Watchmen's characters. Some, like the Comedian and Dr. Manhattan, are fatalists. They believe everything that happens is preordained and therefore cannot be changed. That's why the Comedian isn't interested in being part of the Crimebusters: "You think [catching criminals] matters? You think that solves anything?" he asks rhetorically. "Inside thirty years the nukes are gonna be flyin' like maybugs." He doesn't see the point of crime fighting when the world is going to end soon anyway.

Dr. Manhattan takes a similar yet slightly less pessimistic view. He can see all aspects of time, which means he can experience the future at the same time he's experiencing the past or the present. He knows what's going to happen before it happens. Laurie Juspeczyk and Janey Slater both get angry with him for not preventing tragedies like the assassination of John F. Kennedy, but Dr. Manhattan says he "can't prevent the future. To [him], it's already happening." Instead he makes sure the present matches the preordained future.

There are, of course, plenty of characters who don't believe fate to be immovable. Rorschach and Dan Dreiberg track down the Comedian's murderer and try to convince him to rethink his master plan. Adrian also believes fate can be changed. He does everything in his power to prevent nuclear war between the United States and Russia and establish peace between .

rival nations.

Flawed Heroes

Watchmen differs from the superhero comics that came before it in that author Alan Moore insisted on making his characters three-dimensional. Unlike the early versions of Batman and Superman, Rorschach, Adrian Veidt, Dan Dreiberg, and Laurie Juspeczyk all have good qualities and bad qualities. Some are darker than others, but none, not even Adrian, can be considered a villain. Moore has said in interviews that he "went out of [his] way" to give even the most unpleasant characters positive characteristics. By doing so, the reader can better understand each character's motivations.

Rorschach, for example, is noticeably unkempt and ill-mannered. He breaks into Dan's house without a second thought and eats vegetables straight from the can; he's never clean-shaven and he always smells a little rank. It's hard to sympathize with someone like that. Moore's inclusion of Rorschach's backstory—his negligent mother, his upbringing in a group home, his lack of career training—helps the reader understand why Rorschach is the way he is, which makes it easier for the reader to connect with him.

Likewise, none of the characters are all-out heroes. Dan, who rescues his partner and gets the girl, comes the closest to taking on the classic hero role in Watchmen. Yet he, too, has his bad points, lacking self-confidence out of uniform to the point where he is unable to take any action at all. Only Laurie's prodding gets him into the owl suit and back on the streets. Flawed superheroes are, of course, incredibly common now, but only because of the work Moore did in Watchmen.

Time

The subject of time is a frequent theme in Alan Moore's body of work. In Watchmen Moore proposes that time is a meaningless construct devised for the inferior human mind. In Chapter 9 Dr. Manhattan compares time to "an intricately structured jewel." He can see every side of the metaphorical jewel, but humans "insist on viewing one edge at a time." While regular people can experience only the present, Dr. Manhattan lives through the past, present, and future at the same time. This is one of the reasons he believes the future is preordained. He has already experienced it, so it therefore cannot be changed.

This can be difficult for other characters—and the reader—to understand, which puts an enormous strain on Dr. Manhattan's personal life. He knows before he even meets Laurie that she will someday leave him, yet he feels he must go through the motions of the relationship so its end plays out just as he had already experienced it. The same thing happens when he is accused on national television of causing his ex-girlfriend Janey Slater's cancer. He can see what will happen but cannot take steps to prevent it. The knowledge of what is to come is more of a burden than a blessing, and it brings a certain sadness to Dr. Manhattan's character. He is always aware that his good fortune will someday end.















Bloodied Smiley Face

The most recognizable part of the Comedian's costume is the yellow smiley face pinned to his left shoulder. The accessory is meant to poke fun at people's optimism in a world doomed to nuclear Armageddon. When the Comedian is murdered, his treasured symbol ends up on the sidewalk, with a streak above the left eye. The bloodied smiley face appears in different guises throughout the book. In Chapter 4 there is a smiley face made of rocks on Mars. In Chapter 12 a spark hydrant is smeared with blood; its sockets look like the eyes on the Comedian's pin. Chapter 12 has another hidden bloodied smiley face in the panels immediately after Rorschach's death. Black ice and a scooter handle illuminated against the yellow light of the tunnel form a makeshift smiley face, and steam from Rorschach's recently obliterated body is the streak of blood.

This symbol appears in more than a dozen other places in the book, and with good reason: it represents the grim realities of life. Neither optimism nor power nor strength can erase the ugliness of the human race and people's treatment of one another. Society strives for happiness but finds nothing but misery. This is true for the Comedian, who embraces the world's disastrous fate with grace until he learns about Adrian's plan, which is more terrible than anything he could ever imagine before. The thought of all those lost lives ruins him before he hits the pavement. Even Adrian loses his formerly contagious optimism when he realizes human nature cannot be controlled, and the peace he worked so hard to achieve will be fleeting. The image of the bloodied smiley face reminds the reader the worst can always happen—and probably will.
Nostalgia Perfume

Adrian Veidt's Nostalgia perfume is seen frequently throughout the pages of Watchmen, both in billboard and magazine advertisements and in the hands of the book's characters. Its name was chosen to remind people of better days, encouraging them to buy during times of "global uncertainty." The perfume appears in Watchmen when characters are thinking about "the old days." It's on Sally Jupiter's dresser as she and Hollis reminisce over the phone. Rorschach, who misses the days when vigilantism was legal and admired, keeps a bottle of it in his pocket and apparently douses himself in the fragrance to cover up more unsavory smells. Laurie hurls a bottle of the perfume at Dr. Manhattan's glass clockwork castle after she revisits old memories and realizes the Comedian is her father. When a bottle of Nostalgia is visible, glimpses of an idealized past aren't far behind.
The Black Freighter

The Black Freighter is the comic-within-the-comic read by Bernie, the teenager who sits next to the newsstand every day. It tells the story of an unnamed narrator marooned on a deserted island after a deadly altercation with a pirate ship from hell. It's up to him to find a way back to his hometown and save his family before the pirates arrive. The Black Freighter is a cautionary tale about the dangers of doing what is morally right, and the narrator's plight parallels that of Watchmen's vigilantes, particularly Adrian Veidt. Each man considers himself a moral person, yet each is willing to kill others who stand in the way of a goal. The comic book narrator kills two townspeople so they don't report him to the pirates; Adrian oversees the deaths of the Comedian, Moloch, his three Vietnamese servants, his assistant, several employees, and millions of New Yorkers. They think their aspirations justify the loss of life. When they finally achieve their goals, they are not happy with the men they have become.
Clocks

The clock is one of Watchmen's most prevalent images. An analog clock appears at the beginning of each chapter; its hands tick steadily closer to midnight with the passing of each part of the story. Chapter 1's clock is at 11:58; Chapter 12's is at 12:00. This is symbolic of the Doomsday Clock, a metaphor for the world's proximity to global disaster. The Doomsday Clock was established in 1947, and scientists and security experts determine its movements each year. Rhetoric in favor of nuclear action advances the clock's hands; steps to prevent such actions move the hands in reverse. When determining the Doomsday Clock's movements, experts take factors such as climate change into account as well. However, the clocks in Watchmen advance only as the threat of war increases. This increases the tension with each subsequent chapter and foreshadows calamity at the book's end. That's why even though Adrian Veidt deploys the mutant octopus a little before 11:30 p.m., the clocks all over New York City read midnight.
