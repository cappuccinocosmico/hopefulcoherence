Who are we protecting them from?
Dan, Chapter 2

Dan asks this question as he and the Comedian hold rioting New Yorkers at bay in 1975. The crowd is rioting against the vigilantes, and Dan is beginning to question the usefulness of the vigilantes' profession. The Comedian responds that they're protecting civilians from "themselves," but Dan doesn't seem so sure.

You know how every damn thing in this world fits together except people!
Janey (Manhattans first GF), Chapter 3

Janey says this to Dr. Manhattan shortly after the assassination of John F. Kennedy. She's trying to tell him he lost his humanity when he became a superhuman. His inability to understand the more illogical aspects of human nature prevent him from being a true superhero. This is also a continuation

Identity

As masked crime fighters, all of Watchmen's main characters have dual identities. In some cases the alter egos are the personalities each vigilante wishes they had in "real" life. Dan, for example, feels more confident and powerful when he's dressed as Nite Owl. When he snaps on his utility belt, he no longer worries about nuclear war or unrequited love. Rorschach, whose vigilante work often ends in violence, is better equipped to acknowledge and address the evils of society when he disappears behind his mask. We see him merge with the mask when the only real time we see him vunrable and scared is when the police take off his mask.

Rorschach eventually comes to find himself identifying more with his vigilante persona than his everyday self, which is why the persona of Rorschach supersedes that of Walter Kovacs to become his primary identity.

Right Wing Undertones & the death penalty.

We see Rorschach the main character (ish) of the story express a very right wing ideology throughout most of the series. We see him say things like the world is infested with vermin that are beneath him and that pepole are incapable of change. We see a similar thing with current idelogy of republicanism with similar themes of the need to preserve america against filth (immigrants, or acedemics are frequent subjects of hate.)

Another similar thing can be seen with Rorschach's use of the death penalty. Most of the philosophical reasoning for it stands on the ground that if the person were to be let go he would continue to commit crimes, so the ***only*** solution is murder. It assumes that pepole are incapable of change of any kind.
