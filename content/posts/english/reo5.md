Laurie Juspeczyk is in California visiting her mother, Sally Jupiter, the original Silk Spectre, who lives in an assisted-living community. Laurie tries to hide the fact that Dr. Manhattan is at the Comedian's funeral, but Sally knows all about it from reading the newspaper. Laurie can't understand why her mother doesn't hate the Comedian for trying to rape her years earlier; Sally says, "[Y]ou're young. You don't know. Things change." She shows Laurie old "Tijuana Bibles," or pornographic comics from the 1930s and 1940s, of which she is the subject. Laurie is disgusted, but Sally finds them flattering.

The panels about Sally and Laurie are interspersed with scenes from the Comedian's funeral in New York. Dr. Manhattan, Dan Dreiberg, Adrian Veidt, and a retired villain named Moloch all attend. Their thoughts are shown as flashbacks, presented in chronological order.

1940s: The Comedian makes unwanted sexual advances toward Sally. She fights him, but she's not strong enough to ward off his punches and kicks. Hooded Justice walks in and beats up the Comedian, who makes a snide comment about Hooded Justice's sexual proclivities.
Circa 1966: Ozymandias (Adrian Veidt) is at the first meeting of the Crimebusters, which includes Dr. Manhattan, Silk Spectre II (Laurie), Captain Metropolis, Rorschach, and the Comedian. Captain Metropolis is eager to create an organized group of masked crime fighters, the first since the Minutemen disbanded in 1949. The Comedian doesn't see the point because "inside 30 years the nukes are gonna be flyin' like maybugs." The meeting unravels.
Early 1970s: The United States has won the Vietnam War. In a Vietnamese bar, Dr. Manhattan looks on as a visibly pregnant Vietnamese woman tells the Comedian he can't just walk away from his unborn child. She smashes a bottle in his face, and he shoots her. Dr. Manhattan reprimands the Comedian, who points out that Dr. Manhattan didn't do anything to stop him. "You don't really give a damn about human beings," he tells the perplexed blue superhuman.
1976: Nite Owl (Dan Dreiberg) and the Comedian are holding off a horde of New Yorkers who appear to be rioting against the superheroes themselves. The Comedian tells Nite Owl he's heard rumors about a new law on the horizon, but until then they are "society's only protection." Nite Owl asks who, exactly, they're protecting the citizens from. "From themselves," the Comedian says.
1985: A week before his death, the Comedian breaks into the apartment of Moloch, his former nemesis. Drunk and crying, he rants about a "joke" gone too far. The Comedian goes on and on about how the bad things he's done are nothing like what's coming. He mentions a mysterious island and artists and scientists, but Moloch has no idea what he's talking about.
After scaring Moloch into sharing the final flashback, Rorschach goes to the Comedian's gravestone. He ruminates on the violent ends that come to those who practice violence. The chapter ends with a lyric from Elvis Costello's song "The Comedians."
