# Reo4:Watchmen


### Summary

Chapter 5 opens with Rorschach’s visit to Moloch. Rorschach still suspects that Moloch is responsible for Blake’s death, so he goes to question him. Moloch, however, still denies any involvement. Meanwhile, an attack is made on Adrian Veidt at his company’s headquarters. A reporter is shot and killed in the fray, and Adrian is able to take down the shooter before anyone else is harmed. This event falls in line with Rorschach’s suspicion that someone is out to take the lives of all the former Watchmen. Still suspecting Moloch, Rorschach returns once again to Moloch’s home, this time to find him killed and slumped across the kitchen table. The police have been watching Moloch’s apartment and immediately rush in to apprehend Rorschach.

The next chapter continues as Rorschach is taken to prison, where he is questioned by a psychologist. The doctor wants to understand Rorschach as a person, but Rorschach keeps himself guarded. It is only through Rorschach’s internal flashbacks that the reader sees the abuse he suffered as a child and his killing of a man who murdered a small girl and fed her body to dogs. Rorschach notes that this killing turned him toward crime fighting.
