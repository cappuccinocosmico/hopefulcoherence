# Reading Evidence Option 4
## Watchmen


### Summary

Chapter 5 opens with Rorschach’s visit to Moloch. Rorschach still suspects that Moloch is responsible for Blake’s death, so he goes to question him. Moloch, however, still denies any involvement. Meanwhile, an attack is made on Adrian Veidt at his company’s headquarters. A reporter is shot and killed in the fray, and Adrian is able to take down the shooter before anyone else is harmed. This event falls in line with Rorschach’s suspicion that someone is out to take the lives of all the former Watchmen. Still suspecting Moloch, Rorschach returns once again to Moloch’s home, this time to find him killed and slumped across the kitchen table. The police have been watching Moloch’s apartment and immediately rush in to apprehend Rorschach.

The next chapter continues as Rorschach is taken to prison, where he is questioned by a psychologist. The doctor wants to understand Rorschach as a person, but Rorschach keeps himself guarded. It is only through Rorschach’s internal flashbacks that the reader sees the abuse he suffered as a child and his killing of a man who murdered a small girl and fed her body to dogs. Rorschach notes that this killing turned him toward crime fighting.
## Quotes
>Who are we protecting them from?
Dan, Chapter 2

Dan asks this question as he and the Comedian hold rioting New Yzorkers at bay in 1975. The crowd is rioting against the vigilantes, and Dan is beginning to question the usefulness of the vigilantes' profession. The Comedian responds that they're protecting civilians from "themselves," but Dan doesn't seem so sure.



> You know how every damn thing in this world fits together except people!
Janey (Manhattans first GF), Chapter 3

Janey says this to Dr. Manhattan shortly after the assassination of John F. Kennedy. She's trying to tell him he lost his humanity when he became a superhuman. His inability to understand the more illogical aspects of human nature prevent him from being a true superhero. This is also a continuation of his perception of time as an immovable and deterministic.



## Characters

The Comedian is a cynical character who believes that human nature is ultimately savage. He does not believe that the world can be saved, yet he continues to play a role in crime busting, claiming that he will have the last joke on humanity when it destroys itself in spite of significant intervention. He also sees them as fundamentaly evil, Rorschach says that everyone else hides from the evils of humanity and yet the comedian accepts this. He admires him for that.

*I know I did a study of Rorschach in reo3, but I think I can add to that after this chapters events*

Rorschach is absolutely the most intresting character in the novel (I mean none of the other characters have an entire couple of chapters devoted to there own personal psycology). He is deemed a sociopath by many (sociopath defined as delighting in hacking someones brain with a butchers knife), and indeed his past was riddled with abuse and violence that altered his character. (Very Freudian in nature as well.) Rorschachs mother was a prostitute, and when he was younger, he became the victim of taunting by neighborhood boys on account of his mother’s reputation. Furthermore, his mother often physically abused him and regarded him as a burden. Rorschach took up crime fighting to rid the world of such evil influences. He claims that he ceased to be Walt during a mission to find a kidnapped girl: he found that her kidnapper had killed her and fed her to his dogs to cover up his crime. Rorschach killed him on the spot, and with that murder lost any trace of innocence that he may have had left.

### Right Wing Undertones & the death penalty. Free Write

We see Rorschach the main character (ish) of the story express a very right wing ideology throughout most of the series. We see him say things like the world is infested with vermin that are beneath him and that pepole are incapable of change. We see a similar thing with current idelogy of republicanism with similar themes of the need to preserve america against filth (immigrants, or acedemics are frequent subjects of hate.)

Another similar thing can be seen with Rorschach's use of the death penalty. Most of the philosophical reasoning for it stands on the ground that if the person were to be let go he would continue to commit crimes, so the ***only*** solution is murder. It assumes that pepole are incapable of change of any kind. And that you can be 100% sure of there guilt. Both major things that is assumed often in defense of the death penalty.
