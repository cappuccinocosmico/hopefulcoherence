# The Dragon Prince
### Part 1: The Morals

#### Introduction
*The Dragon Prince* is a childrens TV show created by the head writer of *Avatar: The Last Airbender*, and as would be expected, it carries over many strengths from its predecesor.

#### Morals and Worldbuilding
  *The Dragon Princes* main theme isnt well hidden, its pretty obvious after the second episode that the show is a response to right wing facist movements, (in many places, but probably most notably the election of Trump, as well as some movements in europe.) Its shown that there are no unambigously good characters, even the stereotypical perfect father figure is shown to be responsible for a lot of violent acts.

Its shown that there have been lots of very bloody history, with both sides being complicit in a cycle of violence that spiraled out of control until you reach the events of the main show.

  This theme is expanded upon in the dichotomy between hero and villan. The most primary and distinct difference is the way in that they view opportunities for peace. The heros grow up in a system where they are taught that their enemy isnt a group of pepole like themselves, facing similar issues, as well as being capable of peace, love and understanding. They are taught to see there enemy as bloodthirsty monsters. And yet, when the heros actualy meet one of the opposing forces, they quickly learn that the differences between them are artifical and capricious. Contrast this with the villan, who is primarily defined by inflating the prexisting hatred of the populus to further increase his own power. (In addition, another thing that differentiates him from other antagonists is that he is a geniuine beliver in his own philosophy.)

  This is

#### Examples of Brilliant Writing

I was originaly just going to write a piece on the morals of this series, however afterwards I was thinking that this show also leads by example with its writing and story. First off the writing is execptionaly tight. There are many examples of objects that are only viewed in frame for a second, define the rest of the series, (an example of note is this one scene where a single handprint is used 3 times in the sc)
