Hi everyone!  My name is Nicholas Venner.  I’m a high school student like you are.  I grew up in Littleton and Lakewood, Colorado.

How many of you here are concerned about climate change?

How many of you know people -- friends, relatives, even co-workers -- who don’t really care about climate change?

How many of you know people you think MIGHT be interested in climate change if there is something you can do about it,  but you’re not sure what to say?  



Some people have 2 and 3 jobs just to get by.  A lot of people are just not going to be able to work on this issue, for that reason or others.  
It’s all the more important for us to pursue solutions that are going to help all of us at once. 
It’s also time for new voices.  It’s time for new thinking and new expectations, because A LOT is possible now.
How many people here know that the Platte River Power Authority has said they can go 100% renewable by 2030?  PRPA is publicly owned, not a Wall Street Company that would like to profit from and continue the old system for as long as possible. There’s a lesson in that! 
How many of you are in Xcel territory? (How many of you don’t know where their electricity is from?  Did you know Colorado is the state that is 11th most dependent on coal?)  
Did you know if we didn’t have a monopoly in Xcel territory, and people could cities were allowed to enter contracts for the cheapest, cleanest, most reliable electricity, 
we could have 89% clean electricity by the mid 2020s for one-third less than our dirty energy with Xcel!  Instead of reinvesting faster, Xcel is taking over a half a billion in after-tax profits, that’s $400 from each household, out of Colorado, to their Wall Street investors every year.  
Just imagine if rural communities could own that electrical generation and have that return for their communities (or your community)!  
Just imagine if each of our parents could be saving $400 on their electricity bills every year.  One thing we can all do, is email boardofdirectors@xcelenergy.com every week, and say:
I am a young person growing up in Colorado, and I expect you as our utility manager to do better.  Our future matters.  It matters a lot more than taking every last dime you can, over half a billion dollars per year, from the third of Colorado that you serve, $400 per household, to give to your investors!  That’s greed!
If you want to stay the electricity provider, I and others at my high school (or church, synagogue or other org) want to see your plan for retiring remaining coal plants by 2024.  
And when you reinvest in renewables -- the solar, wind, and batteries that are cheaper now and in the long run -- those should be co-owned with local communities.  
This is your obligation. And no more investment in fossil fuel plants.
We’re not going to forget, and we want to hear that you are doing it.  Please write back soon!
Pueblo Meeting
By the way, Xcel’s Board of Directors doesn’t usually meet in Colorado, but they’ll be here in Pueblo on May 15th at 11 am.  Should we be there to greet them and let them know our expectations?
Yes!  If you’ll be there, I’ll be there! We can’t get in without owning stock but we can be out front.  We can contact them in advance – and after – weekly!  
Put this in your phones now!  Boardofdirectors@xcelenergy.com
Write to Xcel, our biggest monopoly utility in Colorado, and remember to speak as “we”!  What groups are you a part of?  What communities are you from?  You can speak from those.  Be bold!  Use your voice!  Be heard!
It is more important for our future in Colorado than I can possibly describe or say.  To just choose one aspect, since we have limited time
How many of you are familiar with the Dustbowl?  
A lot of people died.  Their animals died.  A lot of people’s businesses dried up.  
You couldn’t breathe.  A lot of people simply had to leave, move away, and try to start a life somewhere else, as a new and often unwelcome immigrant.
Did you know we are on the path to recreating the Dustbowl this century, but worse?  That’s the business as usual path we are on now.  Seriously.  We are on a path where we have an over 80% chance of having worse than Dustbowl conditions statewide, lasting for over 30 years, between 2050 and 2100.  That’s our lives!  In our home state!  This is not okay.  We can turn this around, but we have to get out there and make it happen.
It’s not just affecting us, as you all know.  This drought would stretch from the Midwest to California’s Central Valley, wiping out a lot of our food system.  Clearly we cannot afford to ruin our country and our food supply.
So what do we do?
Turn our electricity systems around – get off fossil fuels fast.  Insist on this!
Talk to your local officials.  
Have coffee with your city council people, or talk to them in that free 3 minutes before their meetings start.  
Email the Xcel board of directors.
Email Gov. Polis, your reps and Senators – we expect a Green New Deal!  Email governorpolis@state.co.us
Keep remaining fossil fuels in the ground.
Stop buying, mining, and investing in what takes fossil fuels.  That’s money wasted, because it’s not going to be able to be used for its full life.
If your family gets a new car, make sure it is electric, with a plug!
New houses should be built with heat pumps instead of gas furnaces. That’s also healthier.  We can go to Zero Net Energy and ZNE Ready for new construction.  Let’s get our state legislature to pass this next year!  Get your local governments to do it!  
Who is with me? (Raise hand)
We get used to thinking things need to be or will continue as they are. There is a better future though, just around the corner.  We can have it, but we have to insist on it and make it happen.  Because some folks have an interest in keeping the old system going as it is.  Some technologies (like the combustion vehicles that have been dominant for 100 years) and the interest groups in power (like fossil fuels and the financial sector) are now out of date. It’s time for change and it can happen!
Change can happen more quickly than you think. 
Did you know that the shift from horse drawn buggies to cars occurred mostly in 12 years?  A shift like this can happen again.
Let’s talk about science for a minute… (keep hand raised)
How many here know that scientists first discovered and newspapers first published about climate change in the 1800s?  It was in newspapers around the country in the late 1800s and early 1900s.
How many knew that the US government has been closely tracking it since the 1950s?  By the 1950s, the US was tracking the ambient emissions in the most remote, uncontaminated place it could find – on Mauna Loa in Hawaii.  The carbon in the atmosphere, the control knob for temperature in the climate, has been marching upward year after year, and the effects are really compounding now.
How many knew that there was consensus about it in the fossil fuel sector and the government in the 1960s, 70s, and early 80s?  
That was understanding that government and the auto industry should get fossil fuel dependence turned around by 1985?
How many of you have seen Merchants of Doubt – about how corporations, tobacco, chemical and fossil fuel companies hire PR firms to sow doubt, confusion and denial?  Google Smoke and Fumes if you want.
Things can change for the better quickly.  It takes people stepping up, not thinking someone, especially someone in power, is going to do it for them.  They have other interests and in general they are not ours.
Juliana v. US, #youthvgov
Our case, Juliana v. US #youthvgov is speaking up for what we share in common, our air and a livable climate.  
Our founding fathers, particularly Jefferson, said the earth is in trust and should not be degraded for future generations.
The government has known about climate change and how devastating it would be for so long – since the 60s at least (google Johnson 1965 climate report) or see bit.ly/WhereHaveWeBeen
There are many, many actions that the government has taken (not just failed to take), that have violated our generation’s constitutional rights to life, liberty, and property, as well as failed to protect essential public trust resources, like the air and our climate.  
Instead, the government has promoted and permitted lots of fossil fuel mining and allowed use of our atmosphere as a dump.  And what is put up there lasts for millennia. 
Our case is trying to bring this to court, but the government has been trying to dispose of it and put it off for the last 3 years.  
That’s why this year we asked for an injunction this year to try to stop more oil leasing in the Gulf of Mexico – you know where the Deepwater Horizon disaster occurred.
We’ve already had 1 C (that’s about 2.8 F) of heating since the industrial era.  Almost all of that to date has gone into the oceans, which ultimately transfer that to the atmosphere.  So we have 30 or 40 years of warming in the pipeline.  This means that we are out of carbon budget now.  
The scientists testifying as part of the case describe how urgent it is to stop fossil fuel emissions ASAP, because we have to bring CO2 levels to lower than what we’ve been talking about, to avoid climate extremes, droughts, and melting polar ice sheets.
The big news from the IPCC last fall was that there is a giant difference between 1.5 C of heating and 2 C.  We can’t let it get to 2 C.  We have to stop filling the bathtub that’s our atmosphere now.  To do that, we have to turn off the spigot.  
The technology is available now to do this, and it is affordable and a better future for us.  We have to get out there and make it happen.  
Did you know that where we stop emitting, that’s basically the temperature that we’ll have for millennia?  So much of what is being caused now is irreversible.  That’s why it is even more important for us to act.
We can do it!  And we can have the better world that is in store, if we change our current path.
Feel free to stay in touch!  I’m glad to work with you on your ideas and actions.  Please pass in the cards with any questions you have or anything you want to say. Thank you!  *END*
On February 8, 2019 the Juliana plaintiffs sought a court order preventing the federal government from issuing leases and mining permits for extracting coal on federal public lands, leases for offshore oil and gas exploration and extraction activities, and federal approvals for new fossil fuel infrastructure. To obtain the order, plaintiffs filed what’s called a motion for a preliminary injunction with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals while the government’s early appeal of the youths’ case is being heard.
