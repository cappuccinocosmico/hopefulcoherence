# Crossings
Are the passages between planes. Other methods of planar transportation exist (mostly by way of random spells in the PHB.) But as for natural passages these are by far the most common.

They are a seemless blend of 2 planes. A feywild crossing in the DMG is described as such

>A traveler passes through a fey crossing by entering a clearing, wading into a pool, stepping into a circle of mushrooms, or crawling under the trunk of a tree. To the traveler, it seems like he or she has simply walked into the Feywild with a step. To an observer, the traveler is there one moment and gone the next.

Because there are no inner planes in this cosmology (for now.) But every outer plane has one crossing to the material plane, and one crossing to the 2 adjacent planes.

## Locations

These crossings occor in locations where there respective allginment is strong

> Ex. For example, lets assume there was this bloody battle where a major city was burned to the ground by evil barbarians, there might be a crossing to Pandemonium or The Abyss, or the capital of the great dwarven city might have a portal to Arcadia.

These crossings can be dispelled with a couple of things, a **dispell evil and good** or **antimagic field** spell of a sufficently high level ocasionaly enough.

Although the most effective way of closing a crossing can be to close it with opisite allignment. (Say that there is a portal to Celestia on the tomb of a paladin, defiling the tomb would close the crossing.)

Crossings can also be opened with specific evil and good rituals. Particulary impressive ceremonies are often enough to open these crossings between planes. And sometimes they can be opened on accident with particularly strong acts.

## Political Impact

Most of the political impact is related to transportation. The most effective way to transport major armies between planes is through these crossings, so a lot of demons and angels will have influence in local governments, and will often lead actions to get these crossings to open in particular places and times.

However most of the concern of these extraplanar entities is on eachother's distruction. So they tend to not bother the surface world unless they initiate a fight.


#Locations

## The Pentarchy
This is the pentarchy, a land composed of 5 human kingdoms with generaly good standings with most of the other factions.
(*DM Notes: This can change if the rulers are assassinated.*)
Frequent crossings in this area tend to include elysium and bytopia.
### Katolis

This is the starter kingdom for the adventure, the king's name is Harrow he is a LG/NG Cleric 3/Fighter 2. He is a character who is moral and wise and a good old "Atticus Finch". He is always kind and his first priority is the security of his subjects above all else (including defeating evil and other such things.)
He also has an unusualy large black and green parrot named Pip who he cares for and loves.
(*DM Notes:Pip is an adolecent Giant Eagle*)



The main capital city also holds the Flagship *Adventuring Outfitters Inc.* Its run by a gnome named price, *Wizard 4*, she is also realy helpful and nice in addition to knowing some stuff about the organisation of *IncSoc* (*DM Notes: Used to be a member of IncSoc*)



### Duren
Mostly a mining country, main source of iron for the pentarchy

Ruled over by a 10 year old queen natalia. level 1 Wizard Gnome NG adopted by human parents.

### Neverwinter
Mainly focused on food production. Has some volcanoes that they use for soil and stuff.

### Estolad
This country controls mostly steppes and is known for breeding some of the best horses for mounted combat out there.

## Slyvania
A coalition of three smaller countries all based in the tropical rainforest area. Frequent crossings to Arborea and the Beastlands Appear in this area
### Placeholderwoodelves
This faction of wood elves mainly focuses on extensive ranged longbow equiped units used to snipe enemies from 500 feet away. and then retreat before chaos can ensue.
### Aeruis
This faction of birdfolk is mainly known for high druidship, the founder of AOI is from this country. The main tactical advantage these birds exploit is using nature magic to shrink boulders to the size of pebbles and pelt them at the enemies from the sky
### Mallorn
The faction of woodland creatures has various abilities that I am way to lazy to write out atm
(*DM Notes:The result of these animal races is a ancient experiment attempted by the elves, and the ill effect was a massive awaken spell cast over most animals in the forest. And over time they became more humaniod.*)

## Silmaril
This faction of island faring sea elves is mostly known for its accute study of the magical arts. Entry to there islands isnt granted often and most of the other empires think of them as xenophobes.

Frequent Planar Crossings include Ceracai, Ysgard and Pandemonium
## Dwarven Trading Coaliton (PLACEHOLDER)
The (PLACEHOLDER) is an alliance of dwarven and haflings.They are pretty isolasionist (except when it comes to iron exports) on the whole and have a hatred of the other dwarven faction on the map. They also happen to be one of the few fully comunist empires out there.

Typical Planar Crossings include Arcadia, Mechanus and Mount Celestia.

### Odocenti
These mountain dwarves make there bases under the largest mountains in the material plane. The largest of these Mt. Caldaris, serves as the base of the capital (also named Caldaris.) This capital is a frequent crossing for arcadia and mechanus.

### Anduin
The hill dwarves and halflings of andunin are a very nice and quaint pepole. They tend to live in the hills themselves and value community. Druidic magic is more common then usual.

# Empire Guilds


All Empire Guilds are very similar, they serve as the face of the government so to speak, they are the primary source of weapons and general combat equipment (and there magical varaieties.) However, they do not give out equipment to whoever shows up with enough cash. Positive standing is required to buy items. (You start out with a standings bonus from your native land.) And progressively higher standings are required to purchase higher level items.

This is important because the empire guilds are differentiated by the items they specialise in, (ex. The Katolis Guild is unlikely to have a Mithril Beserker Axe). So what standings you have with various factions can influence the stuff you can buy.


#### The Katolis Guild
The Katolis Guild tends to specialise in spears, halberds and lances.
#### The Estolad Guild
They Specialise in horses and mounted combat equipment
# Misceleous Guilds

## Adventuring Outfiters Inc


  These are a multi empire guild dedicated to facilitating selling to basic adventuring parties. In here you can find a lot of basic essnetial items. There rations are typicaly the cheapest at half the usual rate (5sp per ration). You can also find some uncommon and common magic items with primarily out of combat use.

 They also sell donkeys.

Example Items:Bag of Holding, Heward's Handy Spice Sack, Alchemy Jug

, Enduring Spellbook.

*In order to remain politicaly neutral Adventuring Outfitters Inc forbids sale of weapons at its stores.*



The owner of Adventuring Outfitters Inc is a little known figure, if you do some digging you can find out that he is a 15th level CN/CG birdfolk druid.


Extraplanar Connections: None



## IncSoc

  Not much is known about this ancient wizard guild. What is known about them is that they arent known to be associated with any faction in particular. They have also set up Telnet. A network of stones that allow telepathic connections using it to extend across the network. This is part of the reason why empires are able to exert more control over there subjects for a usual midevil world.



Example Items: Deck of Many Things, Tomes of Improved Ability Scores, Iron Flask, Well of Many Worlds



Extraplanar Connections: Limbo

*DM Notes: Its possible to set these up as primary antagonists from the far realm. Also their name should have clued you off that they were antagonists*
