## Katolis

This is the starter kingdom for the adventure, the king's name is Harrow he is a LG Cleric 3/Fighter 2. He is a character who is moral and wise and a good old "Atticus Finch". He is always kind and his first priority is the security of his subjects above all else (including defeating evil and other such things.) He also has an unusualy large black and green eagle/parrot named Pip who he cares for and loves.
(*DM Notes:Pip is an adolecent Giant Eagle*)

The main capital city also holds the Flagship *Adventuring Outfitters Inc.* Its run by a gnome named price, *Wizard 4*, she is also realy helpful and nice in addition to knowing some stuff about the organisation of *IncSoc* (*DM Notes: Used to be a member of IncSoc*)

# Empire Guilds

All Empire Guilds are very similar, they serve as the face of the government so to speak, they are the primary source of weapons and general combat equipment (and there magical varaieties.) However the empire guilds are differentiated by the items they specialise in, (ex. The Katolis Guild is unlikely to have a Beserker Axe).

### The Katolis Guild
The Katolis Guild tends to specialise in spears, halberds and lances.
# Misceleous Guilds
## Adventuring Outfiters Inc

  These are a multi empire guild dedicated to facilitating selling to basic adventuring parties. In here you can find a lot of basic essnetial items. There rations are typicaly the cheapest at half the usual rate (5sp per ration). You can also find some uncommon and common magic items with primarily out of combat use.

  Example Items: Lock of Trickery, Bag of Holding, Heward's Handy Spice Sack, Alchemy Jug

  *In order to remain politicaly neutral Adventuring Outfitters Inc forbids sale of weapons at its stores.*

  The owner of Adventuring Outfitters Inc is a little known figure, if you do some digging you can find out that he is a 15th level CN/CG birdfolk druid.

  Extraplanar Connections: None

## IncSoc

  Not much is known about this ancient wizard guild. What is known about them is that they arent known to be associated with any faction in particular. They have also set up Telnet. A network of stones that allow telepathic connections using it to extend across the network. This is part of the reason why empires are able to exert more control over there subjects for a usual midevil world.

  Example Items: Deck of Many Things, Tomes of Improved Ability Scores, Iron Flask, Well of Many Worlds

  Extraplanar Connections: Unknown

  *DM Notes: Its possible to set these up as primary antagonists from the far realm. Also there name should have clued you off that they were antagonists*
