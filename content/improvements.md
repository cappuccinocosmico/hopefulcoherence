# Reflections

Last semester the big issue was lack of focused priorities. The biggest failure of that semester Aerospace & Spanish occured because I thought I was in a good circimstance, I would have 5 hours to do my spanish final, but instead areospace reared its ugly head, and because of stress and lack of time (wouldnt have been an issue if I had allocated time to it beforehand), my time wouldnt have run out and I would have had plenty of time to work on spanish and wouldnt have gotten a C in that Class as well.

No its worth noting here that the only reason I had gotten in that situation is because I had bad managment twards the end of the semester. There is an infinite ammount of things I could have done better. I could have started having more regular spanish meetings at the beggining of december, gotten more credit and gotten more things in and could have gotten a B with little to no stress. I also had at the time the opportunity to spend much more time on aerospace at the end of the semester and would have then scored much higher on the final enabling an A-B in that class as well.

If you add in all of the other things I could have done, like for instance making sure to do all of my math homework on time (leaving the possibility of getting an A in that class significantly more likely.) Or having focused more on Spanish discussions in units 1 and 2 witch would have even oppened up the possibility of an A in that class as well.

All of this makes it very likely that I think that these main goals will be acomplished.

# Goals


1. A's In all Classes

Now this is going to be difficult on several levels, but we can learn from last semester in a number of regards

One of the reasons for my mediocre preformance in math was not doing the homework in preperation for the quiz's. So the main goal to getting a A in math will be too...

2. Have my homework grade in math be at or above my grade in the class.

This will make sure that every Quiz I am adequatly prepared for the material, also doing it on a daily basis will help as well.

3. Make sure no spanish work is turned in late. Or completed suboptimaly.

This will make sure that at the end of the semester there is nothing to do or nothing I wish I had gotten done, this applies in particular to discussion boards

4. Make sure everything you do for english is done with **extensive extensive** consulation with the rubric.

Make sure that you right what you need to write for the teacher, not what you think personaly is good. I also think I will score higher generaly because this class is discussion based.

5. Do all of the Homework on time and stuff in AP Macro

This is a just generaly good studying practice for the tests. although this and english are the classes I am the most scared about.
